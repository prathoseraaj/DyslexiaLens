       "'Cities are busy and complex places, shaped by many different people, their jobs, and big networks like roads. As cities grow quickly, leaders must handle many hard issues. They need to make sure everyone gets a fair share of resources and opportunities. Good city planning means thinking about important things like homes people can afford, transport systems that last, ways to keep everyone healthy, and looking after nature. To do this well, cities need to use facts to make choices. They must talk to all important groups, and use flexible rules. This ensures no one, especially weaker groups, misses out on the benefits of city growth. However, even with good plans, making cities fair often faces problems. Slow paperwork, not enough money, and different political ideas can stop progress. These problems cause delays, broken services, and a lack of clarity, making good plans less effective. As a result, people who are less well-off might still struggle to get key services, live in poor conditions, and face ongoing differences in money and life. This is very different from what city leaders promise about making cities strong and fair. This shows cities must keep checking their work, try new ideas, and work together to run things better.'"
